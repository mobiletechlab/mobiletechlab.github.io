  title: Immutable Architectures
  text: With the advent of cloud computing and the concept of immutable infrastructure, the scaling and deployment of applications has become a lot easier. This increases the possibility of configuration drift as operations manage this cluster of machines, both virtual and actual. In this project a revised view on configuration and architecture is proposed. We propose that software deployed on a public or private cloud should to the furthest possible extent be immutable and source controlled. [.. work in peer-review..]
