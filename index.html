			About <strong> the lab</strong> 
		</p>
		<p>
			The <strong>mission</strong> of the Mobile Technology Laboratory (MoTeL) at Westerdals Oslo ACT, Faculty of Technology, is to design, develop and deploy innovative and value-creating applications and services in individual and organizational contexts and evaluate their adoption, use, and impact.
		</p>
		<p>
			MOTEL’s <strong>vision</strong> is to co-create scientific knowledge and value through innovative applications of information and communication technologies by engaging with multiple stakeholders in the international society and local community.
		</p>
		<p>
			MOTEL seeks to conduct trans-disciplinary applied research at the  intersections of computer science, human computer interaction, software engineering, and social and behavioral sciences with a focus on HCI and mobile applications and services for individuals and organizations. 

			MOTEL’s applied research projects will be theoretically informed by its foundational research program on understanding socio-technical systems and interactions in terms of human-technical affordances and technological intersubjectivity.

			MOTEL seeks to conduct research in close collaboration with industry partners from both private and public sector, in a variety of areas such as commerce, health, interface design, education and communication.
