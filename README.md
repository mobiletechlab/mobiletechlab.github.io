## Adding new research 
There are two to ways to add new research to the `/research` page. Neither way will not require you to restart the website, Github Pages (our webhost) will automatically re-build the page on each commit (change) to the repository.

### Directly via Github
You can add a new Bibtex entry directly to the `research.txt` file on Github, found **[here](https://github.com/mobiletechlab/mobiletechlab.github.io/blob/master/research.txt)**. Simply add a new entry representing your paper, then commit the change.

### Locally on your computer, then push to Github
First, this approach requires you to clone this repository to your machine. If you've already done that, you can change the `research.txt` file found at the root of the project folder. After completing your modification to the file, commit and push the change back to Github.
