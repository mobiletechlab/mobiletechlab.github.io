## Adding new research 
There are two to ways to add new research to the `/research` page.

### Directly via Github
You can add a new JSON object (paper) directly to the `research.json` file on Github, found **[here](https://github.com/mobtechlab/mobtechlab.github.io/blob/master/research.json)**. Simply add a new object representing your paper, then commit the change. 

### Locally then push to Github
First, this approach requires you to clone this repository to your machine. If you've already done that, you can change the `research.json` file found at the root of the project folder. After completing your modification to the file, commit and push the change back to Github.
